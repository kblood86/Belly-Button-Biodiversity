Explore the Belly Button Biodiversity! A catalog of the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The data was defined in the created display showing the demographic information.

To first explore this data a horizontal bar chart was created with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found an individual.

A bubble chart was also created that displays each sample.

Finally a gauge chart was created to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual (0-9).
